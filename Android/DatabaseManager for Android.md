# DatabaseManager for Android

Managing Android apps' SQLite databases is tough while developing. You cannot view the tables, you don't know what is 
getting inserted into the tables and you can't update the data and see how your application responds to it.

What if you had a database manager like oracle sqldevelopr, mysql work bench for your application's SQLite database? 
This library gives you that.

With this library you can manage the database of your android app from the app itself.

You can view, insert, delete, update the tables of your app's SQLite database from your app.

Then entire library is written into a single `Activity` class so you just need to add this Activity to your Android app.

This is how it looks - watch this 1 minute video for demo : http://youtu.be/P5vpaGoBlBY?t=3m40s
