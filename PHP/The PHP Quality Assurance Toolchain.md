# The PHP Quality Assurance Toolchain

### PHPUnit

[PHPUnit](http://www.phpunit.de/) is the de-facto standard for unit testing in PHP projects. It provides both a framework 
that makes the writing of tests easy as well as the functionality to easily run the tests and analyse their results.

### PHPLOC

[phploc](http://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phploc) is a tool for quickly measuring the size of a PHP project.

### PHP_CodeSniffer

[phpcs](http://pear.php.net/PHP_CodeSniffer) tokenises PHP, JavaScript and CSS files and detects violations of a 
defined set of coding standards. It is an essential development tool that ensures your code remains clean and consistent. 
It can also help prevent some common semantic errors made by developers.

### Jenkins PHP

The goal of the [Template for Jenkins Jobs for PHP Projects](http://jenkins-php.org/) is to provide a standard 
template for Jenkins (the leading open-source continuous integration server) jobs for PHP projects.

### vfsStream

[vfsStream](http://github.com/mikey179/vfsStream) is a stream wrapper for a virtual file system that may be helpful 
in unit tests to mock the real file system.

### PHP_Depend

[pdepend](http://pdepend.org/) can generate a large set of software metrics from a given code base. 
These values can be used to measure the quality of a software project and they help to identify the parts of 
an application where a code refactoring should be applied.

### PHP Copy/Paste Detector

[phpcpd](http://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpcpd) is a Copy/Paste Detector (CPD) for PHP code. 
It scans a PHP project for duplicated code.

### PhpMetrics

[PhpMetrics](http://phpmetrics.org/) is a static analyzer tool. It provides a large set of software metrics 
from a given code base. PhpMetrics generates readable and accessible reports about maintainability, quality 
and complexity of a source code.

### Behat

[Behat](http://behat.org/) is a framework for Behavior Driven Development (BDD) that is inspired by Cucumber.

### PHP Mess Detector

[phpmd](http://phpmd.org/) scans PHP source code and looks for potential problems such as possible bugs, dead code, 
suboptimal code, and overcomplicated expressions.

### phpDox

[phpDox](http://phpdox.de/) is the documentation generator for PHP projects. This includes, but is not limited to, 
API documentation.

### QA-Tools

[QA-Tools](http://www.qa-tools.io/) is a library, that makes acceptance test writing a breeze through PageObject pattern 
usage in the tests.
